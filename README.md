# RESUME BUILDER

## About
Hello everyone! this is my **first web development** project. I am excited to share it with you. I develop this project during my **third semester** as **individual**. The purpose of this project is to demostrate my knowledge in technologies such as **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap**. It has been a great learning experience and I am eager to continue learning and improving my skills.
Below are features of this project:

## Features
1. **Home page**: This is the main page of the resume builder. It has a heading which **justify** the purpose of the project. It also has a **button** that links to the next page. I show an image that gives idea of **what exactly output will be**. At last i show some strong reasons to use this project.

2. **Resume page**: This page consist of different sections like **About**, **Education**, **Skills**, **Experience**, and **Projects**. Each section has a **form** where user can input their details. I use **Bootstrap** to make it responsive and user friendly.

3. **validations**: I use **JavaScript** to validate the input fields. It checks if the fields are empty or not also uses **Regular Expressions** to match patterns.

4. **Preview section**: This section is used to display the resume in a **Dynamic way** means user can see the resume in real time. I use **JavaScript** to update the resume whenever user input something in the form.

5. **Print cv**: This feature is used to print the resume. I use ``windows.print()`` function to print the resume. later on i will use **pdf generation** library to generate the resume in pdf format.

6. **Repeater Functionality**: It uses a jQuery script that initializes a repeater functionality for a form element with the class ``.repeater``. It ensures that the code inside the function runs only after the DOM is fully loaded. It prevents any manipulation of elements that may not yet be available. This functionality is not implemented by me i refer it from a website.

7. **Formating**: I use **CSS** to make the resume look good and user friendly this improves appearance and formating of overall website. If you want to change entire theam of website then you can change the **CSS file root variables**. It also utilizes **Google Fonts** to make the text look more beautiful and presentable.
